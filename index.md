## Brief Biography

👋🏻 Hi Guys, Welcome to my Homepage! My name is WANG Zikang (王紫康), and you can also address me as **_Jackson_**. I'm now a Ph.D. student affiliated with [Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technology](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/abct/) at [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU)](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/) and it's my great honor to be advised by [Dr. LAU Chun-Yu](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/abct/people/academic-staff/dr-wilson-lau/) majored in [Cryo-EM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryogenic_electron_microscopy) based strcutral biology since January 2024. Prior to this, I graduated with a M.Phil. (**Highest Honors**) from [University of Macau (UM)](https://www.um.edu.mo/) in 2023 under the supervision of [Prof. LEUNG Chung-Hang](https://duncanleung.weebly.com/) majored in probe-guided bio-imaging and gained my B.S. in biology (gifted class) from [Yunnan University (YNU)](https://english.ynu.edu.cn/) in 2020, where I worked closely with [Prof. SUN Jianwei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=rBnexnkAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) & [Prof. CUI Qinghua](https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57204714662) and gained valuable suggestions from [Prof. DANG Yunkun](https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=16066680100), [Prof. LAI Fan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Nu5UvagAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) & [Prof. YANG Chonglin](https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=7407744066).

📖I would really appreciate it if you could go through my [M.Phil. Thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ynLGTefNfxEPhhBsfTdnsk6CTtZn2_PE/view?usp=sharing)

📌I’m always ready for exploring potential (overseas) collaborations (especially with those from non-biological backgrounds, e.g., CS, EE). Therefore, do not hesitate to drop me an [email](mailto:zikangwang1023@gmail.com) if you are interested in what I am focusing on or have some other topic(s) to chat and chat.
