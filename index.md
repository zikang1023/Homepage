## Biography

👋🏻 Hi there! Welcome to my homepage! My name is Zikang WANG「王紫康」, and you can also address me as **_Jackson_**. I'm now a Ph.D. student affiliated with [Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technology (ABCT)](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/abct/) at [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU)](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/) and it's my great honor to be advised by [Prof. Chun-Yu LAU](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/abct/people/academic-staff/prof-wilson-lau/) majored in [Cryo-EM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryogenic_electron_microscopy) based strcutral biology since 2024. Prior to this, I graduated with a M.Phil. (**Highest Honors**) from [University of Macau](https://www.um.edu.mo/) in 2023 under the supervision of [Prof. Chung-Hang LEUNG](https://duncanleung.weebly.com/) majored in probe-guided bio-imaging and gained my B.S. in biology (gifted class) from [Yunnan University](https://english.ynu.edu.cn/) in 2020, where I worked closely with [Prof. Jianwei SUN](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=rBnexnkAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and gained valuable suggestions from [Prof. Yunkun DANG](https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=16066680100).

📌I’m always ready for exploring potential (overseas) collaborations (especially with those from non-biological backgrounds). Therefore, do not hesitate to drop me an [email](mailto:zikang.wang@connect.polyu.hk) if you are interested in what I am focusing on or have some other topic(s) to chat and chat.
